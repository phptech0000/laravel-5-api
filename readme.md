## Example Laravel API

 This is a sample project to show how you could write an API using Laravel 5.
  
 There will be some minor differences, specially regarding downloaded packages, as I used the 
 excellent [Laravel Ide Helper](https://github.com/barryvdh/laravel-ide-helper) to setup
 PhpStorm bindings and other features.
